== Active Idea

Active Idea is a very simple Digg-like interface for idea management. Users can enter an idea and others can vote
and comment on it.  There are XML feeds for both ideas and comments.

Active Idea has no login system, it is purely cookie-based. This means that someone can impersonate someone else
if they wanted to.
